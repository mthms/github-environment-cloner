[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/<your-username>/<repository-name>?style=social)](https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>/stargazers)

**`clone-github-environment-variables.sh`** is a lightweight bash script designed to **duplicate GitHub environment variables** from one environment to another within the same repository. This script is perfect for developers and DevOps engineers looking to streamline environment setup, synchronize configurations, or manage multiple environments efficiently.

## üöÄ Features

- **Effortless Cloning**: Automatically duplicates all environment variables from a source environment to a target environment.
- **Validation**: Ensures variable names are valid and skips empty values to avoid errors.
- **Customizable**: Works with any GitHub repository by simply specifying the source and target environments.
- **Efficient**: Leverages GitHub CLI (`gh`) and `jq` for seamless processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before using the script, ensure the following tools are installed:
1. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: [Installation Guide](https://cli.github.com/)

3. **Run the Script**:
   Provide the source environment, target environment, and repository as arguments.
   ```bash
   ./clone-github-environment-variables.sh <source_env> <target_env> <repo>
   ```
   - **`<source_env>`**: Name of the environment to clone from (e.g., `staging`).
   - **`<target_env>`**: Name of the environment to clone to (e.g., `production`).
   - **`<repo>`**: GitHub repository in `owner/repo` format (e.g., `your-username/your-repo`).

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   ./clone-github-environment-variables.sh integration production your-username/your-repo
   ```

4. **Verify the Changes**:
   Check the target environment in your GitHub repository to ensure variables have been cloned successfully.
